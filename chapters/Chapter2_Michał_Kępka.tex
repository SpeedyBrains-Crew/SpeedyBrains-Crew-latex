\paragraph{Learn C++.}
We recommend reading this tutorial, in the sequence listed in the left menu.
C++ is an \textbf{object oriented} language and some concepts may be new. Take breaks when needed, and go over the examples as many times as needed.
C++ is a \textbf{cross-platform} language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
C++ was developed by \textbf{Bjarne Stroustrup}, as an extension to the C language.
C++ gives programmers a \textit{high level of control over system resources and memory}.
The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

\paragraph{C++ Install IDE.}
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.
Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.
Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.
We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.
You can find the latest version of \textit{Codeblocks} at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.
